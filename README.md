# Computer Vision and Data Preprocessing

Welcome to the **Computer Vision and Data Preprocessing** repository! This collection of projects aims to showcase my expertise in computer vision and data preprocessing techniques within the field of data science. Each project in this repository highlights my skills in developing computer vision models and effectively preparing data for meaningful analysis and modeling.

## Why Computer Vision and Data Preprocessing?

Computer vision plays a crucial role in extracting valuable insights from visual data, while data preprocessing ensures that the input data is accurate, consistent, and properly prepared for analysis. This repository demonstrates how I handle image-based tasks and address challenges related to data quality and preprocessing.

## What You'll Find

Each project in this repository showcases various aspects of computer vision and data preprocessing, including:
- Developing custom image classification models for real-world applications.
- Handling image data, annotations, and labels.
- Detecting and addressing challenges related to data quality and preprocessing.
- Visualizing and interpreting model predictions and decisions.

## Projects

Here's a list of projects you'll find in this repository:
- [Project 1: Parking Hassle: Parking Lot Occupancy Detection]: Building a custom object detection model using the PKLot dataset to predict parking space occupancy in different weather conditions.
- [Project 2: Image classification]: Building a custom CNN model to classify images, comparing results with pre-trained models.
